# Silly Shell profile
Fairly large Linux/UNIX profile including 250 functions. Build over the course of 15 years, it features many shortcuts to get things done in daily Operations. I don't think anyone else than the maker of one's script should use it at all, but why not sharing anyway?


# Presentation
## Features
* Bash ONLY
Formerly developed around KSH93, it used to be both **KSH** *and* **Bash** compatible, but maintaining this was a headache and abandonned.

* Compatible with old system V and old Linux not really maintained.
Because sometimes you are not the one to decide to install packages in Production.

* Optimized for xterm-256color
* 250 functions to ease your daily job
* KSH `FPATH` emulation
* Emulation of commonly mnissing binaries on some systems: **egrep, mktemp, print, printf, readlink, realpath**
